Dialogue module for Moodle (http://moodle.org/)
===============================================

The Dialogue module allows for private conversation between two or more parties.

They can be useful when the teacher wants a place to give private feedback to a
student on their online activity. For example, if a student is participating in
a language forum and made a grammatical error that the teacher wants to point
out without embarrassing the student, a dialogue is the perfect place.
